# Flutter Studies(and Dart)
This is my first season to study Dart and Flutter.

# Download APK:

# On Linux machine

# Update your path

<p>
1 - Determine the directory where you placed the Flutter SDK. You will need this in Step 3. </p>
<p>
2 - Open (or create) $HOME/.bash_profile. The file path and filename might be different on your machine.
</p>
3 - Add the following line and change
[PATH_TO_FLUTTER_GIT_DIRECTORY] to be the path where you cloned Flutterâ€™s git repo:
<pre>
$ export PATH="$PATH:PATH_TO_FLUTTER_GIT_DIRECTORY]/flutter/bin"
</pre>
<p>
4 - Run source $HOME/.bash_profile to refresh the current window.
</p>
<p>
5 - Verify that the flutter/bin directory is now in your PATH by running:
</p>
<pre> $ echo $PATH</pre>
